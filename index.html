                    <h2>Hi, this is Bao.</h2>
                    <h3> Adventurer. Dancer. Harry Potter Fan.</h3>
                    <p>Highly creative digital marketing specialist with a passion for technology and arts who values the importance of innovation. Originally from Munich, Germany I embarked my Singapore journey in 2016, and started as an intern at Gardien Group, the largest independent printed circuit tester globally. My role covers managing Gardien's website and the planning and execution of global marketing activities.</p>
                <p>Aside from my full time job, I consult small businesses, by consulting them on their digital marketing strategy. I am proficient in InDesign, Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.</p>
                <p>I created websites for businesses in Germany with wordpress and gogodaddy. After managing Gardienâ€˜s corporate website and creating some amateur websites, I've been looking into learning how to code websites myself. My colleague introduced me into TechLadies last year, and ever since I have been attending your info sessions and I was anxiously awaiting your next application to take a leap and try my luck. The reason I chose TechLadies over an online programming course is because of the hands on mentality, blended with the support of the TechLadies community. My ultimate goal would be to change my career path from a Marketer into IT. Hence, I'd like to work with like-minded people to help and support each other while giving back by putting my newly acquired skills to a good cause. </p>
                <p>Thank you for taking the time to review my application, please let me know if you should require more information. </p>
                <p>I look forward to working and growing with TechLadies. </p>
                <p>Sincerely,</p>
                <p>Bao</p>
